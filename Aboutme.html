<p>About Me</p>
<p>Hello there! Thanks for checking out my website. My name is  Catherine Nau. I have been doing nails since February of 2018. Making people  feel great about themselves have been my passion ever since I started working  in this industry. It also gives me a sense of accomplishment. When it comes to  nails people tend to think it is a feminine thing and does not associate with  men which I completely disagree. Self-care should be essential for everyone,  and gender roles should not play a big role in that. So many different services  are offered here except acrylic nails since I have allergy to the dust, but we  have color dip powder that will be a great substitute for it if you haven&rsquo;t  tried them already, I will highly recommend you that. I take pride in my work  and if you get gel color they should last about 2 weeks. If anything happens  the first week, please do come back or at least give me a call so that I can  fix them for free. Customers&rsquo; safety is my priority and I take very serious  about providing clean / comfortable environment by changing new pedicure liner  after each use, clean the tools with disinfectant solution, and only use &ldquo;  single-use &ldquo; supply to prevent from any cross contamination. Every client&rsquo;s  opinion matters to me because I would not be who I am today without you all. So  feel free to give me feedback / suggestions/ comments that will help me and my  business. I hope I live up to your expectations and thank you so much for being  a part of this journey! I will see you soon! </p>
